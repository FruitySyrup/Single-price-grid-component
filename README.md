# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is a solution to the [Single price grid component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc). 

This is the second challenge I've done.

*Note that I did not have the figma/sketch file to get exact pixels, colors or styles. I did make deviations from the style-guide.md when they did not match the final design.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I wanted to do a simple project for my second challenge, something that I could do all on my own with little outside reference. This challenge was a good refresher of using flexbox.
